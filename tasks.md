# Tasks

- [x] Reduce build size
- [x] UMD build
- [x] Webpack build
- [x] component prop
- [x] Delay rendering of components along with the animation because it seems weird when component
has been rendered by React but animations are delayed. This will keep both in sync and will be
processed through the timeout prop (type: Number). Though this won't be replacing the delay
attribute of an animation but its an addon for existing library.
- [ ] Code refactor
- [ ] Component Transitioning
- [ ] Misc Components like perform animation and then disapper (Node removal from DOM instead of hiding using component state which is imperative).
