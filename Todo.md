# Todo

- [ ] Multistep animations and transitions (currently it works if you nest two or more animation components but I don't think it's the best way to do this).
- [ ] Refactor the code.
- [ ] Tests.
- [x] Type checking (optional).
- [ ] Making animations more flexible.
- [x] Linting
- [x] Make site more attractive (may be some animation demo)
